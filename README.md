# Mystery Number

Mystery Number is a little game that i create in Python.
A random number between 0 and 100 is generated and you have to find it.
I will tell you if it's too big or too small.
Good luck !

## Installation

Clone the repository on your machine.

Then you have two options :

if you're under Python2 
The correct file for you is Play.py, you'll have to change the import instruction in main.py

if you're under Python3
The correct file for you is Play_typed.py, you have nothing to change.

## Usage 

In your terminal console :

```bash
python3 /folder_directory/main.py
```
